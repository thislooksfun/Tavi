Welcome to the official website / blog for [Tavi]({{ site.producturl }})!

This blog is a place where I will (hopefully) be providing progress updates for Tavi's development.
If this is something that interests you, please let me know. My twitter account is [{{ site.contact.twitter.username }}]({{ site.contact.twitter.url }}), my GitHub is [{{ site.contact.github.username }}]({{ site.contact.github.url }}), and the repository is located over [here]({{ site.projecturl }}).

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to let me know. I may not have time to respond to everything, but I really do appreciate the feedback.

If you have any (friendly) criticisms, _please_ let me know. Hearing that people like it is wonderful, but hearing that people don't is valuable. Without constructive feedback, the app will not be able to evolve and fit people's needs.  
That being said, please _don't_ send me messages saying "your app sucks, and I hate you." If you think it sucks, please let me know why. If it's something I think I can fix, I will do my best to do so.

For those of you who enjoy looking at other people's code,
